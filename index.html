      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">
        I’m a full-stack engineer based in Calabasas, just outside Los Angeles. Over the past few years, I’ve worked as a professional software engineer, mostly at fast-paced startups where adaptability and strong fundamentals matter.
</p>

      <p class="text-sm">
      I grew up in the San Fernando Valley, and have been interested in technology my entire life. I started programming
      when I was 13 years old, and have since turned it into a full-time career.

      <p class="text-sm">
      In my free time, I like to cook/bake, and I’m working on adding a few of my favorite recipes to this site. I’m also a strong advocate for online privacy, security, and internet freedom.</p>

        I've worked with a wide variety of languages, libraries and frameworks throughout my career. In order to keep
        my resumes concise, I tend to shorten my skills list down to the most common/relevant technologies. For anyone
        who's curious, however, here is a broad list of all languages, technologies, and platforms I've worked with.

                    `Python, Go, and JS/TS are by far my most used programming languages, but I'm also skilled with a few other
        languages. While I'm still new to it, I'm extremely interested in the Elixir/Erlang/OTP
        ecosystem, and really enjoy the Phoenix web framework so far. I'm also a big fan of Rust, and have been gradually adopting it as my primary
        language for systems programming.`,

        and FastAPI like the back of my hand. I have worked with nearly every major package in the Django ecosystem,
        and have been using FastAPI professionally since the framework first rose to prominence. I also use Golang's
        standard library extensively for backend projects, although I tend to add a few libraries I'm very fond of
        (particularly <code class="">github.com/jmoiron/sqlx</code> and <code>github.com/go-chi/chi</code>). In the
        past, I've also used Node.js frameworks, particularly Express.js and Nest.js.`,

                    with React, and I almost always use TypeScript for React projects that aren't trivial.
        Currently, my favorite frontend stack is React + ShadCN + TypeScript + TanStack Query + Tanstack Router + Zustand
        (if global state is needed). I've also shipped code in other frameworks, including a visual data dashboard
        application with Angular and SyncFusion, a real-time Google Docs-style editor in Vue.js with Quasar, and this website,
        which uses Alpine.js.`,

        both MySQL and PostgreSQL. I usually choose PostgreSQL for new projects unless I have a compelling
        reason not to, and opt for MongoDB for those edge cases where I legitimately need the flexibility
        of a document store. Redis/Valkey is my preferred cache/KV store due to its simplicity, performance,
        and built-in features for horizontal scaling, data streams, and geographic data. Furthermore, I've worked
        on a few projects that involved embedded databases, specifically BoltDB and SQLite.`

        server deployments, desktop application builds, and package signing. I've been using Linux since I was
        in high school, and went through the stereotypical distro-hopping phase in my sophomore year. I've written
