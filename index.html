      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">About Me</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">I grew up in Los Angeles, and have been interested in technology basically my entire life.
        I first learned how to program when I was 13 years old, starting out with simple toy programs and
        eventually gravitated towards web development. For the last few years, I've been working as a professional
        software engineer, primarily at fast-paced startups. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking and baking, and
        I'm working on gradually getting all my goto recipes up on this site. I currently live in Calabasas, just
        outside Los Angeles.</p>

      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">My Technical Background</h2>
      <p class="text-sm">
        I've worked with a wide variety of languages, libraries and frameworks throughout my career. The
        lion's share of my past work experience has been in web, but I've also dabbled in
        mobile development, desktop app development, systems programming and blockchains. As I've found it difficult
        to fully convey my technical background in-depth on my resume, I've added some detailed explanations about
        different parts of my skillset.

        languages. While I've yet to substantially adopt it for my personal projects, I'm extremely interested in the Elixir/Erlang/OTP
        ecosystem, and have a lot of respect for functional programming. I'm also a big fan of Rust, and have been gradually adopting it as my primary
        language for systems programming.`,

        and FastAPI like the back of my hand. I have worked with nearly every major package in the Django ecosystem,
        and have been using FastAPI professionally since the framework first rose to prominence. I also use Golang's
        standard library extensively for backend projects, although I tend to add a few libraries I'm very fond of
        (particularly <code class="">github.com/jmoiron/sqlx</code> and <code>github.com/go-chi/chi</code>). In the
        past, I've also used Node.js frameworks, particularly Express.js and Nest.js.`,

        frontend framework is by far React, and I almost always use TypeScript for React projects that aren't trivial.
        Currently, my preferred frontend stack is React + ShadCN + TypeScript + TanStack Query + Tanstack Router + Zustand
        (if global state is needed). I've also shipped code in other frameworks, including a visual data dashboard
        application with Angular and SyncFusion, a real-time Google Docs-style editor in Vue.js with Quasar, and this website,

        reason not to, and opt for MongoDB for those edge cases where I legitimately need the flexibility
        of a document store. Redis/Valkey is my preferred cache/KV store due to its simplicity, performance,
        and built-in features for horizontal scaling, data streams, and geographic data. Furthermore, I've worked

        I've deployed in the last few years has been containerized. I've written advanced CI/CD pipelines to handle
        server deployments, desktop application builds, and package signing. I've been using Linux since I was
        in high school, and went through the stereotypical distro-hopping phase in my sophomore year. I've written
        and deployed systemd services on several production Linux servers (mostly targeting Ubuntu, Debian, and RHEL),
